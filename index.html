						Blue Barn Wagyu is a small family owned and operated local ranch located in the center of the beautiful and fertile Willamette Valley in the state of Oregon. We specialize in Wagyu cattle.<br/> 
						Wagyu is a high-quality beef sold in many high-end restaurants and specialty meat markets. We raise our cattle completely grass fed, with no hormones or Antibiotics at any time.  The only 
						supplement our animals get are vitamins at birth, with a concentration of selenium as that mineral is missing from our valley, and it very important to any animals healthy upbringing.

			We raise only full blood Wagyu beef cattle.  This breed is known as the “Caviar of Beef”, due to its marbling, flavor, and texture.
			I guess now is as good a time as any to clear up a huge misconception…..  
			Wagyu, known as the “Caviar of Beef” is also incorrectly know and marketed as “American Style Kobe or Kobe Beef” in the United States.   Kobe is an area in Japan, where the Wagyu breed started, and was imported from, into the US in the late 1980’s.  Wagyu is the breed, and when raised in the US, it cannot be called Kobe or American Kobe, as obviously, Kobe is only in Japan.  If Wagyu is Imported from Kobe Japan as finished beef, (not as a live animal) in can then be called Kobe beef.  You will pay substantially more for finished Kobe imported directly from Japan.  Hope this helps you understand what you are buying.
