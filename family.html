			<h2>Blue Barn Ranch Family</h2>
			Blue Barn Cattle Ranch is a small family ranch operated by a native Oregon family with deep ties to the dairy and beef cattle business in Oregon for nearly 80 years.  It started all the way back to Great Great Grandpa Ross, who came out from North Dakota during the depression.  He settled in the Corvallis area with his family and eventually ended up being the President of the Oregon Dairy Breeders Association in the 1950’s and early 1960’s.  Turns out he was on the cutting edge of Artificial Insemination.<br /><br /> 
			60 Years later his Great Grand Daughter graduated from Oregon State University in Animal Sciences and has been instrumental in the return of the family to ranching and cattle production since her graduation.  She married into a local family that also had cattle background and well, it just all took off from there.  One of her projects had been to do a business plan for a small ranch that was going to raise specialty beef, in this case Wagyu.  I am her father Monte, and I am owner and operator of the ranch along with my wife and other family members lending a hand with their various areas of expertise.   Not to leave out a generation for all you history buffs, my father, Ross’s son Howard, has had many new memories made on our ranch during his visits that take him back to the time he spent with his father on the ranch during his child hood, prior to going into the navy to serve the country.  He loves being here and tossing a bale of hay around now and then.<br /><br />
			It truly is a family business, along with our daughter, both sons help with Technology and our son in law uses his long time familiarity of the valley and his family’s contacts to help supply expert assistance with the many aspects of the infrastructure needed to develop a animal friendly, natural and healthy ranch.  Not to be forgotten of course are the many friends and neighbors that have all been supportive of our venture as well.  The real joy for us is the land, the animals, the view from our ranch at Sunrise and Sunsets (so many amazing shows of nature’s beauty looking west clear across the valley to Mary’s Peak) and the interaction of the family when we are all together.  It is a grandparents dream and we are blessed to have all of these wonderful things in our life.  A early highlight was to be able to have all the family and extended family sitting out in lawn chairs on a warm and clear July 4th, watching the local fireworks show from town only about 400 yards away with our cattle milling around us.  We had lots of laughs from the “city folks” being that close to the cattle, and some of the comments they made.  Earlier in the day we had 12 strong men pulling on chains to drop the old barn that was leaning way over.    Wonderful memories made that Independence Day!<br /><br />  
			Now we invite you to take a closer look at what we can do for you with our amazing Wagyu Beef, “The Caviar of Beef”!  If you have never tried Wagyu, please give it a try, you will be amazed with the tenderness and flavor of this beef and we hope you can create new memories in the enjoyment of Wagyu.
